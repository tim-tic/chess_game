## Description

PyChess is a Python-based chess game created using the Pygame library. What began as a simple "why not" idea during school has evolved into a full-fledged chess game project that embraces modern software development technologies and practices.

## Journey

This chess game project was originally started as a casual endeavor but was put on hold for a while. However, with newfound knowledge of modern development tools and methodologies gained over the past year, the project has been revived with a fresh perspective.

## Key Features
- **Python and Pygame:** The game is built using Python, a versatile and easy-to-understand programming language, and Pygame, a popular library for developing 2D games.
- **Classic Chess Gameplay:** PyChess offers a traditional chess experience, complete with all the standard rules and gameplay elements that chess enthusiasts know and love.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The game features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced chess players.
- **Modern Development Practices:**
    - **Continuous Integration (CI):** The project incorporates CI to ensure code quality and maintainability, allowing for automated testing and deployment.
    - **Documentation with Sphinx:** Comprehensive documentation is provided using Sphinx, making it easy for users and contributors to understand the project's structure and functionality.
    - **PEP 8 Compliance:** The code adheres to PEP 8 coding style guidelines (PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal for code formatting).

## Project Goals
The primary goal of PyChess is to create an enjoyable and feature-rich chess game that serves as a testament to the developer's growth and mastery of modern software development practices. By embracing continuous integration, extensive documentation, and code style standards, PyChess aims to set a high standard for open-source Python game development.

## Future Plans
- Multiplayer functionality, allowing users to play against friends or opponents online.
- Capabilities for the single-player mode.
- A customizable interface and theme options to tailor the game's appearance to individual preferences.
